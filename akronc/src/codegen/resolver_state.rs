//! Resolver-state hookup for the `Compiler` orchestrator.
//!
//! Covers the dispatch machinery: the manual install path (for tests
//! and CLI flows that build their own [`SymbolTable`] and
//! [`ResolvedProgram`]) and the in-memory-root auto-build path
//! invoked from [`Compiler::compile`] whenever the caller didn't
//! install a state up front.
//!
//! Two free helpers live here too — `program_has_imports` and
//! `has_import` — since they're used only by
//! `try_auto_build_resolver_state` to gate multi-module auto-build
//! on `base_path` being set.
