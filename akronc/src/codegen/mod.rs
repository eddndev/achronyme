//! Top-level `Compiler` orchestrator — the struct that owns every
//! compile-time interner, the function-compiler stack, the module
//! system state, the resolver dispatch maps, and the warnings list.
//!
//! The public entry is [`Compiler::compile`]. This module's bulk is
//! the `struct Compiler { … }` declaration; the methods and helpers
//! that operate on it are split across sibling files by concern:
//!
//! - [`compile`] — the main `compile(source)` entry and the
//!   `is_terminator` helper re-exported as `pub(crate)` for
//!   `control_flow::mod` to share.
//! - [`constructors`] — `Default`, `new`, `with_extra_natives`.
//! - [`diagnostics`] — `cur_span`, `emit_warning`, `take_warnings`,
//!   `collect_in_scope_names`, `MIGRATED_TO_METHOD`, and the
//!   "did you mean?" `undefined_var_error` builder.
//! - [`resolver_state`] — `install_resolver_state` +
//!   `try_auto_build_resolver_state` (resolver / dispatch-maps /
//!   availability / outer-functions hookup) plus the
//!   `program_has_imports` / `has_import` gate helpers.
//! - [`wrappers`] — register alloc / intern / emit / `current` /
//!   `append_debug_symbols` thin delegations.
