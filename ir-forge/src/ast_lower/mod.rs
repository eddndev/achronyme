//! ProveIR compiler: AST Block → ProveIR template.
//!
//! Compilation is split per-concern across the submodules below; each
//! one contributes one or more
//! `impl<F: FieldBackend> ProveIrCompiler<F> { ... }` blocks. This
//! file owns the type definitions and the [`ProveIrCompiler`] struct
//! they share.
//!
//! ## Submodules
//!
//! - [`api`] — public entry points (`compile`, `compile_with_trace`,
//!   `compile_circuit`, `compile_prove_block`, plus the internal
//!   `compile_into_instance` backbone).
//! - [`state`] — constructor + resolver-hit tracking + Circom template
//!   registration.
//! - [`stmts`] — 16 statement walkers (`compile_block_stmts`,
//!   `compile_stmt`, declarations, assignments, imports, ...).
//! - [`exprs`] — expression compilation, organised as a submodule
//!   directory: `compile_expr` dispatcher in `exprs/mod.rs`, plus
//!   `atoms` (literal + ident), `control` (if / index / block-as-expr),
//!   `for_loop` (`compile_for_expr` + carry-set detector), `inline`
//!   (user-fn inlining), and `ops` (binop / unary / `extract_const_u64`).
//! - [`calls`] — 21 call-dispatch + builtin-lowering methods (Circom
//!   integration, M2 annotation dispatch, per-builtin lowering).
//! - [`methods`] — 11 dot-access + method-call helpers (arity checks,
//!   assert message extraction, len() carve-out).
//! - [`helpers`] — 4 free utilities (`program_to_block`,
//!   `flat_index_suffix`, `to_span`, `annotation_to_ir_type`).
//! - [`tests`] — 159 tests (only compiled under `#[cfg(test)]`).
//!
//! Cross-submodule calls go through `pub(super)` visibility; the
//! struct fields are also `pub(super)` so each concern can read +
//! mutate the shared compiler state.
