//! OpCode definitions for the Achronyme VM
//!
//! This module defines the complete instruction set for the VM.
//! Instructions are encoded as 32-bit values with the following formats:
//!
//! Format ABC: [8-bit opcode][8-bit A][8-bit B][8-bit C]
//! Format ABx: [8-bit opcode][8-bit A][16-bit Bx]
//!
//! Register-based instructions use A, B, C as register indices (0-255).
