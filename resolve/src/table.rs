//! The unified symbol table — the single source of truth for every name
//! both compilers can resolve.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! - [`SymbolTable`] struct with a fixed storage layout.
//! - Empty constructor, lookup by qualified name, alias-chain resolver.
//! - Ownership of a [`BuiltinRegistry`] with audit integration.
//!
//! [`SymbolTable::new`] produces an empty table wrapping an empty
//! registry. The module-graph walker, the AST annotator, and the
//! builtins installer live in their respective sibling modules.

/// ## Ownership model
///
/// The table owns:
/// - The flat `symbols` vector, indexed by [`SymbolId`].
/// - The `by_qualified_name` map for O(1) name lookup.
/// - The `builtin_registry` (its entries are referenced by
///   [`CallableKind::Builtin::entry_index`]).
///
/// A [`SymbolTable`] is built once per compilation session and then
/// passed by reference to both compilers. Neither compiler mutates the
/// table.
