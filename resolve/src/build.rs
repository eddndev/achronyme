//! Shared resolver-state construction.
//!
//! Both the VM bytecode compiler and the ProveIR compiler need to
//! build a [`ModuleGraph`] then [`SymbolTable`] then [`ResolvedProgram`]
//! chain for the same program. This module is the single entry point
//! they both call (see `akronc::Compiler::try_auto_build_resolver_state`
//! for the VM-side wrapper).
//!
//! The helper is intentionally thin — it owns the call order
//! (`register_builtins` then `register_all` then `annotate_program`) and
//! nothing else. Everything upstream (which [`ModuleSource`] adapter,
//! which root path, whether to even build a resolver state at all) is
//! still the caller's call.
//!
//! ## Why a struct instead of a tuple
//!
//! Callers store the three outputs as separate `Option<T>` fields on
//! the compiler. A struct makes the install-vs-build split explicit:
//! [`ResolverState`] is the "built" shape; the compiler destructures
//! it into its own fields at install time.

///   fns it's `"{alias}::{name}"` where `alias` is the string the
///   importer chose in its `import "./..." as {alias}` statement.
///   This matches the mangling the VM bytecode compiler applies
///   during its recursive `fn_decl_asts` aggregation, so the

///   `compile_user_fn_call` consults to push the definer's module
///   onto the resolver stack before inlining. Both the annotation
///   path and the legacy StaticAccess path go through this push,

/// ## Alias derivation
///
/// The alias for each non-root module comes from the
/// [`ImportEdge::alias`](crate::module_graph::ImportEdge) field of
/// the graph edge that imports it. For diamond imports (the same
/// target imported under different aliases by different
/// ancestors), the iteration order of [`ModuleGraph::iter`]
/// determines last-write-wins — consistent with how the VM
/// compiler's `fn_decl_asts` handles the same case today, so no
/// new divergence.
///
/// Selective imports (`import { a, b } from "./x"`) have an empty
/// `alias` string in their edge; their [`CallableKind::UserFn`]
/// entries are skipped (they'd use bare names that collide with
/// the root). This helper covers namespace imports only;
/// selective-import symbols fall through to legacy dispatch
/// unchanged.
///
/// ## Layering
///
/// This function lives in `resolve` because its inputs and
/// outputs are entirely resolver types (SymbolTable, ModuleGraph,
/// SymbolId, String). The "convention" it encodes — that
/// non-root fn_table keys are `{alias}::{name}` — is a property
/// of the resolver's naming model, not a compiler-specific hack.
/// Both the VM bytecode compiler and the ProveIR compiler call
/// this same helper.
