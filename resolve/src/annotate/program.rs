///    downstream compilers keep using their local-variable storage.
/// 2. the current module's own symbols in the [`SymbolTable`] (private
///    + exported fns registered by [`register_module`](super::register_module)).
/// 3. selective imports (`import { foo } from "lib"`) — the importer's
///    alias is empty, the name must appear in
///    [`ImportEdgeKind::Selective::names`](crate::module_graph::ImportEdgeKind::Selective).
/// 4. namespace imports (`import "lib" as l`) — only reached for
///    [`Expr::StaticAccess`](achronyme_parser::ast::Expr::StaticAccess)
///    and [`Expr::DotAccess`](achronyme_parser::ast::Expr::DotAccess),
///    where the leading `l` is the import alias and the trailing
///    `::foo` / `.foo` is the exported name.
/// 5. builtins — caught by step 2's bare-name lookup if
///    [`register_builtins`](super::register_builtins) ran before this
///    function.
///
/// Unresolvable names are **silently omitted** from the returned map.
/// Downstream consumers fall back to their legacy lookup for any
/// `ExprId` not present in the map, so the resolver can ship
/// incrementally without breaking existing behaviour.
///
/// ## What this pass deliberately skips
///
/// - `Expr::Call`'s own annotation. The callee is already walked and
///   annotated; the `Call` node itself doesn't need a separate entry
///   (callers follow the callee's id).
/// - [`FnAlias`](crate::symbol::CallableKind::FnAlias) creation —
///   `let a = p::fn` const-folding lives elsewhere.
/// - Static members (`Int::MAX`, `Field::ZERO`). The
///   [`statics::lookup`](crate::statics::lookup) table is currently
///   empty; for now we fall through to the namespace-import check and
///   the compilers keep their legacy static resolution.
/// - `ConstKind` refinement. Exported lets are parked as
///   `ConstKind::Field`; this walker does not touch that.
/// - Module graph audit. The caller should run [`SymbolTable::audit`]
///   separately after registration and annotation finish.
///
/// ## Definer's scope
///
/// The walker annotates each expression **against the module that
/// declares it**, not the module that eventually inlines it at lowering
/// time. That is the whole point of doing this at parse time: a
/// reference to `hash_node` inside `tree::merkle_step` resolves to
/// `hash::hash_node`'s `SymbolId` now, so by the time the ProveIR
/// compiler inlines `merkle_step` into a `prove {}` block in `main.ach`,
/// there are no bare names left for it to re-resolve against the wrong
/// scope.
